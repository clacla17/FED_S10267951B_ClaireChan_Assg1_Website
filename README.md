# Claire's Spotify Web
For this assignment, I decided to attempt to recreate a platform that I absolutely love and use very frequently. That platform is called Spotify.
In my website, I focused on three key pages of the actual Spotify Web. This includes the homepage, a playlist page and also a search page.
By focusing on the layout and interactivity of these three pages, I have evidently suceeded in creating a very similar replica of Spotify's website.

## Features included in my website
1) Album Pop-Up
   - When hovering on playlists of the side panel, the respective details of each album will pop up right on the side.
2) Interactive buttons
   - When hovering over any button in my website, it will do one of two things.
   - Either they increase in size, or there is a visual change in their background colours.
3) Scrollable sections everywhere
   - There are both vertical and horizontal scrolls in my website.
4) Buttons that direct you to another page when clicked
5) Very responsive

### Other features I want to add:
- Being able to actually play a song.
